# Overview

This short tutorial describes a way to make a virtual machine configured for creating and running machine learning models created using [Edge Impulse plaform](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/), for a [Silicon Labs Thunderbird Sense 2 Iot Kit](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/thunderboard/thunderboard-sense-two-kit).

The virtualization environment is VirtualBox, and the guest machine runs Linux Mint 20.1.

# Prerequisites

* Hardware: a 64-bit computer with enough memory so that the VM can be granted 16 GB, with a few tens of GB available on the disk, and one free USB A port
* Hardware (bis): a [Silicon Labs Thunderboard Sense 2 board](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/thunderboard/thunderboard-sense-two-kit) with an USB A / micro USB B cable
* Developer:
    * basic knowledge of Linux (knowing the most common commands...)
    * basic knowledge of VirtualBox (knowing how to create a virtual machine...)

# Creation of the VM
